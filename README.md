# StardewValleyFunds

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

# Specs

- [x] As a user, I want to see a list of all projects, ideas, and charitable acts that are seeking funding.

- [x] As a user, I want to click a project to see more details.

- [x] As a user, I'd like to know the details of a project before I decide whether to fund it.

Including things like:
* a name
* the project starters/managers,
* a description
* the amount of money the project is hoping to raise
* what they'll do with the funds raised
* whether I get any cool swag or rewards for funding a project.

- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to filter projects as I browse them. Perhaps by the amount of funding they still require, or whether they're charitable acts, ideas for products, or other.

- [ ] As a user, I want to click a button or fill out a form to fund a project.

- [x] As a user, I want the option to post my own project or charitable act that seeks funding.

- [ ] As an administrator, I want to add, update, or delete projects as necessary. (User authentication is not required).

- [ ] As a user, as the site grows I want ideas, projects, and charitable acts to be separate types of objects, each residing on their own page. Things like charitable acts might have different types of properties/details than companies seeking startup funding, too.

- [ ] As a user, I want to select a category to view a page containing all projects in that category.
